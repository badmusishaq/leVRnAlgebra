# FAQ LeVRnALgebra

## What is leVRn: Algebra?

LeVRn: Algebra is an educational virtual reality experience developed by Imisi 3D, as part of our VR for Schools project, aimed at offering quality educational content for secondary school students. The experience is a VR module designed for Algebra in Mathematics taught in the Nigerian Junior Secondary School Curriculum. It is to be used alongside traditional teaching methods to supplement teaching as well as improve learning.

To develop the experience, the team worked closely with a Mathematics teacher to ideate the best approaches to take when handling the topics. The teacher also played a vital role in developing the content and testing to make sure it was conducive for the students.

The project is open source and backed by UNICEF Innovation Fund.

## Who is it for?

The module was designed for students in the second year of Junior Secondary School in Nigeria. The experience can be used by teachers in class or students at home.

## What platform was the experience built for? (headset)

The experience is currently only supported by the Oculus Go headset

## Is it open source?

Yes, it is open source. Anyone can download and use the module or contribute to the development by making a pull request on Github.

## How do I open the project in Unity?

To get a copy of this project working properly in Unity, follow these simple steps:
- Download the project folder.
- Open the project with Unity 2019.2.3f1.
- Ensure the platform is set to Android in Build Settings
- Build the .apk, load it into an Oculus Go.

## What language was it written in?

The modules were created in Unity 3D and the language of development is C#.

## Is it accessible to the visually impaired and deaf?

We are extremely passionate about inclusivity but virtual reality is highly dependent on the senses especially sight and hearing. We are currently working on creative ways to make our modules more inclusive. 

## Are there any evaluations? 

There are in-app evaluations to test the competency of the students. After each new concept is taught, the students play a game where they are asked questions to go over everything that has just been taught. Each model has multiple evaluations to keep the student engaged with each new concept that is taught.

## How can a teacher use it in their class?

The modules all have a home page with a card showing a brief description of each class and a start button. We advise the teacher to give instructions to the students to wear their headsets and have them all start at the same time. After the VR class, the teacher can go over all of the concepts taught in the class and give notes if deemed necessary.

## Are there any downsides?

VR is relatively new as a consumer product and with most technology of this sort, we are still learning about the adverse effects they might have on us. As such, we advise users to exercise the same type of caution they would with other screen devices (eg phones, televisions). The modules have been adopted to minimise motion sickness and other side effects that are popular with Virtual Reality.

## What are the advantages?

VR has a lot to offer in terms of improvement to learning. Virtual Reality makes learning more exciting and engaging for the students. VR has also been proven to be beneficial to learning as it capitalises on the concept of constructivist learning (i.e students learn by creating memories from experience.) Finally, VR activates the visual and olfactory areas of the brain which has been proven to improve retention.
